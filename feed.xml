But what about “archeology” that isn’t accepted by modern standards? Well that might fall under the definition of pseudoarchaeology, which refers to interpretations of the past from outside the archaeological science community, which reject the accepted data gathering and analytical methods of the discipline. This week, Leah brings some examples ranging from aliens building the egyptian pyramids to the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, she brings her friend Nathan, an archeology grad student and professor to give his profession insight on this “alternative archaeology”. (Hint: Listen to find out how weird it gets!)&lt;/p&gt;
