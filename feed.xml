&lt;p&gt;The “Boy in the Box” is the name given to an unidentified murder victim, a 4-to 6-year-old boy, whose naked, battered body was found in a bassinet box in the Fox Chase section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 25, 1957. This week, Leah brings in the details to this dark cold case, while Chris and Gavin debate who the unknown child is. (Hint: Listen to find out!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our third cult episode, Chris brings in his research about the Manson Family, and the trials that followed the Manson Murders. The Manson Family was a commune and cult led by Charles Manson that was active in California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The group consisted of approximately 50 followers, who lived an unconventional lifestyle with habitual use of hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD. (Hint: This episode is not for the faint of heart.)&lt;/p&gt;

The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form who may find them. This week, Gavin talks about some of the images, music, sounds, and greetings on the record, while Leah and Chris pitch a new updated record that they think should be sent into space. (Hint: The world was very different in the late 70s.)</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.thisstrangeworldpodcast.com/assets/CoverArtSeason1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.thisstrangeworldpodcast.com/assets/CoverArtSeason1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Real-Life Buried Treasure - Season 2 Episode 10</title><link href="https://www.thisstrangeworldpodcast.com/2021/04/19/Real-Life-Buried-Treasure/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Real-Life Buried Treasure - Season 2 Episode 10" /><published>2021-04-19T05:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-04-19T05:30:00-04:00</updated><id>https://www.thisstrangeworldpodcast.com/2021/04/19/Real-Life-Buried-Treasure</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.thisstrangeworldpodcast.com/2021/04/19/Real-Life-Buried-Treasure/">&lt;p&gt;Everyone has had the child-like wonder to look for buried treasure in their backyard and at the beach, but you never really find much. Some people take it to the next level, cracking hundred year old cyphers and looking for hidden artwork in the mountains and gold buried in forests. This week, Chris brings in some true stories of real buried and hidden treasures throughout time while Gavin and Leah start to plan trips to find them. (Hint: X marks the spot!)&lt;/p&gt;
