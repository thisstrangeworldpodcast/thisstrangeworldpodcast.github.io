Flying cryptids have evolved a number of different times without a single ancestor that brings them together. Think of any big bird with wings, it can probably be categorized as a flying beast.

This is the category for all feline or cat based cryptids. Cats are well-represented in cryptozoology and cryptid cats have been the sole subject of a variety of cryptozoological works. Mystery cats fall into various categories with different possible explanations, including alien big cats, undocumented hybrids and colour morphs, emergent species, possible undescribed species, and theoretical survivals of prehistoric cats.

A lake monster is a purported form of fresh-water or saltwater dwelling megafauna appearing in mythology, rumor, or local folklore. A well known example is the Loch Ness Monster (which we did a previous episode about in June 2021, check it out!). Lake monsters’ depictions are often similar to some sea monsters. Many lake monsters were considered to be dragon like sea serpents in the early sightings, however, most of all lake monster sightings in modern times describe the beasts to have long necks and large bodies with flippers. (Hint: Better watch where you’re swimming this summer!)&lt;/p&gt;

A lake monster is a purported form of fresh-water or saltwater dwelling megafauna appearing in mythology, rumor, or local folklore. A well known example is the Loch Ness Monster (which we did a previous episode about in June 2021, check it out!). Lake monsters’ depictions are often similar to some sea monsters. Many lake monsters were considered to be dragon like sea serpents in the early sightings, however, most of all lake monster sightings in modern times describe the beasts to have long necks and large bodies with flippers. (Hint: Better watch where you’re swimming this summer!)</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.thisstrangeworldpodcast.com/assets/CoverArtSeason4.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.thisstrangeworldpodcast.com/assets/CoverArtSeason4.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Cryptids: Plantae - Season 4 Episode 4</title><link href="https://www.thisstrangeworldpodcast.com/2022/07/27/Cryptids-Plantae/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cryptids: Plantae - Season 4 Episode 4" /><published>2022-07-27T00:05:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-27T00:05:00-04:00</updated><id>https://www.thisstrangeworldpodcast.com/2022/07/27/Cryptids-Plantae</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.thisstrangeworldpodcast.com/2022/07/27/Cryptids-Plantae/">&lt;p&gt;For our fourth episode in our Cryptids season, we’re going to talk about plantae, or plant based cryptids! They may be 100% plant, such as the fern flower, or partly plant, such as the Moss man or the Honey Island Swamp Monster. (Hint: This episode is sure to grow on ya!)&lt;/p&gt;

A poisonous and/or venomous cryptid is a cryptid (such as snakes, scorpions, spiders, plants, etc…) that produces any toxin for predatory or defensive purposes. The poison can be found in the blood, muscles, liver, be processed by specialized glands, or be found in the sap of plants. Not all cryptids are equally toxic for life and in some cases the production of toxins varies depending on the time of year. (Hint: Stay a safe six feet from these cryptids.)&lt;/p&gt;
