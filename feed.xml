But what about “archeology” that isn’t accepted by modern standards? Well that might fall under the definition of pseudoarchaeology, which refers to interpretations of the past from outside the archaeological science community, which reject the accepted data gathering and analytical methods of the discipline. This week, Leah brings some examples ranging from aliens building the egyptian pyramids to the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, she brings her friend Nathan, an archeology grad student and professor to give his profession insight on this “alternative archaeology”. (Hint: Listen to find out how weird it gets!)&lt;/p&gt;

But what about “archeology” that isn’t accepted by modern standards? Well that might fall under the definition of pseudoarchaeology, which refers to interpretations of the past from outside the archaeological science community, which reject the accepted data gathering and analytical methods of the discipline. This week, Leah brings some examples ranging from aliens building the egyptian pyramids to the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, she brings her friend Nathan, an archeology grad student and professor to give his profession insight on this “alternative archaeology”.

In recent years, many of these disappearances have been attributed to paranormal activity or extraterrestrial beings. Most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery, but Gavin, Leah, and Chris have decided to take it upon themselves to decide if there is any legitimacy to the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.
