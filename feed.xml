Supernatural cryptids are described as having anomalous and unexplained abilities, and are often linked with Spirits and Demons. Pretty much any cryptid that can be attributed to some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature. (Hint: Did that shadow in the corner of my room just move?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the finale of the main part of the season, so we’re going to take a few weeks off, but maybe we’ll be back when it gets a little spookier out… To quote Gavin, “Who’s to say?”&lt;/p&gt;

Flying cryptids have evolved a number of different times without a single ancestor that brings them together. Think of any big bird with wings, it can probably be categorized as a flying beast.

Mystery cats fall into various categories with different possible explanations, including alien big cats, undocumented hybrids and colour morphs, emergent species, possible undescribed species, and theoretical survivals of prehistoric cats.

A lake monster is a purported form of fresh-water or saltwater dwelling megafauna appearing in mythology, rumor, or local folklore. A well known example is the Loch Ness Monster (which we did a previous episode about in June 2021, check it out!). Lake monsters’ depictions are often similar to some sea monsters. Many lake monsters were considered to be dragon like sea serpents in the early sightings, however, most of all lake monster sightings in modern times describe the beasts to have long necks and large bodies with flippers.

The poison can be found in the blood, muscles, liver, be processed by specialized glands, or be found in the sap of plants. Not all cryptids are equally toxic for life and in some cases the production of toxins varies depending on the time of year. (Hint: Stay a safe six feet from these cryptids.)&lt;/p&gt;

Aliens are creatures from space, or any living creatures that are not originally from Earth. They could be anything from simple bacteria to intelligent life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a cryptid to fall under this category, they typically have to fit at least one of the following descriptions: the ability to speak, and confirms through its dialogue that it is of extraterrestrial origin; is generally thought of as an alien, or has an appearance or traits similar to that of known Alien Cryptids; visit earth in spaceships or flying discs; the witness(es) that saw the cryptid claim it was or refer to it as an alien. (Hint: Something that without a doubt exists in one of those galaxies from the new NASA pics.)&lt;/p&gt;

Aliens are creatures from space, or any living creatures that are not originally from Earth.

Last season we had the running theme of Bizarre Experiences, but this season we’ve found a new theme…Cryptids! You know, Bigfoot, The Loch Ness Monster, things like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every episode this season we are going to be doing a deep dive into a different type of cryptid. Our season premiere starts the season with humanoids, cryptids similar to humans in their anatomy. Some are also thought to be intelligent on a human level since they seem to have evolved in a similar path. Humanoid cryptids typically have the ability to walk upright (biomechanic bipedalism), two eyes (binocular vision), and are typically not quite human (like human mixed with another animal-anthropomorphic). (Hint: It’s like you, but different.)&lt;/p&gt;
