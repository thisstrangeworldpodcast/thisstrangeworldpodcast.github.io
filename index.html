In our second episode about Cryptids, Chris explains the legends behind The Loch Ness Monster, Skinwalkers, and the Beast of Truro, leaving Gavin and Leah to wonder if there is some truth to these mysteries.

          </a>
        </h3><p>Now when most people think of the Men in Black, they probably think of the 1997 film, Men in Black, starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, but did you know the movie might be based on a real organization. Strange sightings over the decades have created a conspiracy about a real-life supernatural organization known as the “Men in Black”. This week, Leah brings in some suspicious stories about the illusive organization, while Gavin and Chris decide if the tall tales have any possibility of being real. (Hint: We recommend steering clear of potential Men in Black.)</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>The components of music grab on tight to our emotional circuitry. In times of trouble, music is there to soothe the soul and ease the mind. This week Gavin, Leah, and Chris explore why music is an essential component of movies and TV, as well as how music is used to reduce stress. Plus, our friend Ray joins us to explore the mysteries of how music has such a hold on our emotions and why music therapy exists. (Hint: Music always helps the vibes.)</p>

        </h3><p>The Voyager Golden Records are two phonograph records that were included aboard both Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977. The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form who may find them. This week, Gavin talks about some of the images, music, sounds, and greetings on the record, while Leah and Chris pitch a new updated record that they think should be sent into space.

          </a>
        </h3><p>Everyone has had the child-like wonder to look for buried treasure in their backyard and at the beach, but you never really find much. Some people take it to the next level, cracking hundred year old cyphers and looking for hidden artwork in the mountains and gold buried in forests. This week, Chris brings in some true stories of real buried and hidden treasures throughout time while Gavin and Leah start to plan trips to find them. (Hint: X marks the spot!)</p>

This week Leah brings in some of the biggest misconceptions about the Mongol Empire and Genghis Khan. She also brings her friend Sam Bass, a professor of Mongol and East Asian History at Simon Fraser University in Canada. (Hint: Strap in, because things are gonna get technical.)</p>

Whether it’s a billion years from now or next week, that hasn’t stopped people from trying to predict a potential impending doomsday.

The event became known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident. This week, Chris explains what allegedly happened on that mountain, while Gavin and Leah come up with their own conspiracies about the ultimate demise of the expedition.

          </a>
        </h3><p>North Sentinel Island is a remote island near the coast of India. It is home to the Sentinelese, an indigenous people in voluntary isolation who have defended, often by force, their protected isolation from the outside world. In 1956 it was made illegal to be within five nautical miles of this island in order to prevent the resident tribespeople from contracting diseases to which they have no immunity. This week, Chris brings Leah and Gavin some stories about this tribe that is still living in the stone age, and the people who have attempted to visit North Sentinel Island.

          </a>
        </h3><p>Archaeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. But what about “archeology” that isn’t accepted by modern standards? Well that might fall under the definition of pseudoarchaeology, which refers to interpretations of the past from outside the archaeological science community, which reject the accepted data gathering and analytical methods of the discipline. This week, Leah brings some examples ranging from aliens building the egyptian pyramids to the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, she brings her friend Nathan, an archeology grad student and professor to give his profession insight on this “alternative archaeology”. (Hint: Listen to find out how weird it gets!)</p>

        </h3><p>The Bermuda Triangle is a region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean where multiple ships and aircrafts are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
