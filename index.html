            Cryptids: Humanoids - Season 4 Episode 1
          </a>
        </h3><p><em>This Strange World</em> is back with our fourth season! Last season we had the running theme of Bizarre Experiences, but this season we’ve found a new theme…Cryptids! You know, Bigfoot, The Loch Ness Monster, things like that!</p>

<p>Every episode this season we are going to be doing a deep dive into a different type of cryptid. Our season premiere starts the season with humanoids, cryptids similar to humans in their anatomy. Some are also thought to be intelligent on a human level since they seem to have evolved in a similar path. Humanoid cryptids typically have the ability to walk upright (biomechanic bipedalism), two eyes (binocular vision), and are typically not quite human (like human mixed with another animal-anthropomorphic). (Hint: It’s like you, but different.)</p>

The multi-day race is held every year in southern Morocco, in the Sahara Desert. It has been regarded as the toughest foot race on Earth. What followed was a near deadly experience that pushed Prosperi to his breaking point. This week, Chris guides us through the ultramarathon that almost killed Mauro Prosperi.

This week, Leah brings in some suspicious stories about the illusive organization, while Gavin and Chris decide if the tall tales have any possibility of being real.
